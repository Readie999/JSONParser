# JSONParser
JSON Lexer and Parser

Written in JFlex and CUP. Created via Eclipse plug-in, found at http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/eclipse.php.

This JSON parser takes an input and checks if it is a valid JSON object according to the JSON specification found at http://www.json.org/.
No output suggests the input is valid, where as a failed message will be shown if not valid.
